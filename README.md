# Hey, I'm Henry 👋

Senior DevOps Engineer at [TED](https://ted.com), where I wrangle AWS 
infrastructure, ECS deployments, and Terraform automation to help ideas worth 
spreading actually spread.

I'm also on the board of [NewHaven.IO](https://newhaven.io) — a tech community for 
the greater New Haven, CT area. If you're local, come hang out!

## What I'm building

- **[Jane](https://github.com/Quinncuatro/jane-mcp-server)** — an MCP server for 
  knowledge management that lets LLMs reference your own docs and specs. Getting 
  some organic traction in the MCP ecosystem.
- **[henryneeds.coffee](https://henryneeds.coffee)** — my blog and home base, 
  where I write about DevOps, LLMs, and whatever I'm currently obsessing over.

## What I care about

Infrastructure that doesn't wake you up at 3am · Developer experience · 
Community building · Automating the boring stuff
